					Hey there, I'm rumkugel13, a software dev who likes to experiment with code and try new things.
				</p>
				<p>
					I learned programming in high school in the mid 2010s, starting with C#. Since i always wanted to make games, I created a few small projects in my free time.
					I started with C# and Microsofts WPF, since I was familiar with it from school. The first game I made was a Tetris clone, which was a lot of fun to make. 
					You can find it on my GitHub, including all the other games i made since.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since WPF isn't really suited for games, I switched to MonoGame, which is a framework for making games in C#. 
					I didn't want to use Unity or any other of the big game engines, since I wanted to learn how to make games from scratch.
					So after creating an Asteroids clone, i decided to try and make a library for making games in MonoGame, which I called "Kadro" (Esperanto for 'Framework').
					This project became a playground for experimenting with game engine concepts, like input handling, scene management, and more.
					I created more games with it, like a Pool game with physics and others with different mechanics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course there are other interests of mine, so i started to make other projects from tutorials and challenges I found online.
					I really like computers and software in general, so learning how they work is a lot of fun for me.
					That's why i created compilers, interpreters, and other low-level projects.
				</p>

				<!--P.S.: I got ADHD, so I often switch between projects and ideas, which is why many of my projects are unfinished or include unfinished/unused features.-->
