					These are some games i developed over the years.
					Some of them i made in a few weeks, others took longer (I didn't work full-time on them).
					Sometimes i continued development after a few months/years, so i provided just the year the project started.<br>
					Executables and/or source code are not available for now.<br>
					Click on the preview images to see a full screenshot of a project.<br>
					As you can see, most if not all games are copies/clones of other well-known (arcade) games.
					I have yet to develop an original game, but these helped a lot in learning how to make games.
